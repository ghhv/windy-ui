# Windy UI
## A Tailwind based component library for Blazor.

Windy UI is a UI sample library for Blazor using Tailwind CSS. The styles are meant to match as much as possible what Tailwind UI has to offer. Because Tailwind UI is both not free and also not Blazor compatible.

I started on this project to make available and easier the possibility of using Tailwind CSS with Blazor in a way that is more practical than to always start from scratch. Windy UI is not a fully complete UI Library at this point, as in, it's not a nuget package you can install and have at the ready in any of your projects just yet. Windy UI is at the moment, a guide for how to write a component library that is based on Tailwind CSS.

The types of components Windy UI currently has implemented are:

 - Buttons
 - Cards
 - Form elements (with complete validation support)
 - Icons (Using Hero Icons)
 - Modals
 - Navigation elements
 - Notifications
 - Table
 - Tabs
 - Typography

Feel free to browse around or ask me any questions directly about the project. I plan to make Windy UI reach maturity to a point that it can be more easily used the way other UI component libraries are used. You can see the work done so far [Here](https://windy-ui.techgems.net/).
