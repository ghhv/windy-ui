        Windy UI is a pet project by Carlos Jimenez (Tech Gems link). It's purpose is to provide an example of how to work with Tailwind CSS on Blazor and provide sample components inspired in Tailwind UI.
        This is not meant to be a fully fledged component library, but rather, a starter for anyone to change and build their own custom Tailwind powered component library.

        If you're intested in this project you can download it <a class="text-primary font-semibold" href="https://github.com/techgems/windy-ui" target="_blank">here</a> and you can choose to <a class="text-primary font-semibold" href="https://ko-fi.com/techgems" target="_blank">buy me a coffee</a> if you'd like.
        When you fork this repo, feel free to use this sample Blazor WASM app to display and test your components in isolation as you make changes to the logic and styles based on your needs.
